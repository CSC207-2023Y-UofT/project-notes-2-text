FileMenuFactory method:
Used the factory method design pattern to implement the creation of popupmenus used when files are long-clicked. This allows the option of quickly extending the list of available file options in the future if necessary. The factory design pattern is particularly useful here since it prevents the need for repeated creations of the same popupmenu view object.
